This is a Minecraft mod which extends Cobblemon and the `cobblemon-unimplemented-items` ([Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon-unimplemented-items)) mod by [tnetcalfe89](https://github.com/tmetcalfe89) (for more info: [CREDIT](./CREDIT)).

## Features

This mod adds Rusty Bottle Caps to change all the different IVs of your Pok√©mon to 0.

Rusty bottle caps can be crafted quite easily. They are one-to-one interchangeable with the bottle caps from `cobblemon-unimplemented-items`.
